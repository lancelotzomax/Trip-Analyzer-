# Trip-Analyzer
This project aims to do the multi-used sentiment analysis of tourists' reviews via Text Mining and recommend tourist attractions to visitors with Word Cloud. Here, we take 46 tourist reviews as dataset examples and generate a word cloud with names of the most popular tourist attractions frequnetly mentioned in the reviews.

To accomplish the analysis and display, please follow the steps following:

There are 3 files other than README uploaded in this repository: "Trip Analyzer.txt", "kuala-lumpur-travel-blogs-dataset.rar" and "Maskarray". 
Before generating "Trip Analyzer.txt", please download "kuala-lumpur-travel-blogs-dataset.rar" and "Maskarray" two files and upload them to the path "/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks". These two files include the dataset of reviews and the picture of the mask. Then, generate "Trip Analyzer.txt". There will be five steps demostrating how to analyze the popular tourist spots from reviews and generate a word cloud to display the result.
